## About Grafana Loki

Grafana Loki is a log aggregation tool built for scalability, high availability, and multi-tenancy. Inspired by
Prometheus, it focuses on simplicity and cost-efficiency. Instead of indexing the full content of logs, Loki organizes
them using labels attached to each log stream.
