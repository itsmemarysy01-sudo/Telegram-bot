## About Kubernetes Scheduler (kube-scheduler)

kube-scheduler assigns newly created Pods to nodes. It watches for Pods without a scheduled node, evaluates node
feasibility and scoring (including taints/tolerations, affinities, and resource constraints), and binds Pods to the
selected node.

Use this image when you need a hardened, minimal container image for running the Kubernetes scheduler as part of a
Kubernetes control plane deployment.
