## About DataHub Upgrade

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform for the modern data stack, designed to enable data discovery, observability,
and governance across complex data ecosystems. Originally developed at LinkedIn and now maintained as a community
project under the LF AI & Data Foundation with Acryl Data as the primary commercial backer, DataHub provides a unified
catalog for tracking data assets, lineage, and ownership. For more information, visit https://datahub.com.

The `datahub-upgrade` component is a run-to-completion batch container that performs system upgrades, index rebuilds,
and maintenance jobs against a running DataHub deployment. It is designed to be executed as a Kubernetes pre-install or
pre-upgrade hook so that schemas, indices, and configuration are fully migrated before the rest of the DataHub stack
(GMS, frontend, and consumers) starts the new version.

## Supported upgrade jobs

Pass the job name with the `-u` flag to the container entrypoint (for example, `-u SystemUpdate`):

- **SystemUpdate** — applies default configurations, ingests system defaults, and emits a readiness signal on the Kafka
  topic `DataHubUpgradeHistory_v1`. All other DataHub services wait for this signal before serving traffic. This is the
  standard job to run during a version upgrade.
- **SystemUpdateBlocking** — blocking subset of SystemUpdate. Use when an upgrade includes a long-running migration that
  must fully complete before dependent services can start.
- **SystemUpdateNonBlocking** — non-blocking subset of SystemUpdate. Use when the migration can proceed concurrently
  with dependent services starting.
- **RestoreIndices** — rebuilds Elasticsearch search and graph indices from the primary metadata store by replaying MCL
  events. Supports optional arguments: `batchSize`, `batchDelayMs`, `numThreads`, `aspectName`, `urn`, `urnLike`, and
  `urnBasedPagination`.
- **RestoreBackup** — restores the SQL document store from a backup file. Requires `BACKUP_READER` and
  `BACKUP_FILE_PATH` environment variables to be set.
- **EvaluateTests** — runs Metadata Tests in batches. Recommended as a scheduled Kubernetes CronJob, typically once per
  day.

## Bundled tools

In addition to the `datahub-upgrade.jar` Spring Boot application (Java 21), the image ships:

- **`kubectl`** — Kubernetes CLI, used by some upgrade jobs that perform Kubernetes-side operations during migration.
- **OpenTelemetry Java agent** — bundled at `/datahub/datahub-upgrade/lib/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar`. Activated by
  setting `ENABLE_OTEL=true` at runtime.
- **JMX Prometheus agent** — bundled at `/datahub/datahub-upgrade/lib/jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar`. Activated by
  setting `ENABLE_PROMETHEUS=true` at runtime; binds to port 4318 when enabled.
- **Entity registry** — `entity-registry.yml` placed at `/datahub/datahub-gms/resources/entity-registry.yml` as required
  by the DataHub JAR at startup.

## Image variants

This image is available in runtime, dev, and FIPS variants:

- **Runtime** (`dhi.io/datahub-upgrade:<tag>`) — minimal production image running as the non-root `datahub` user (UID
  65532). No shell or package manager included.
- **Dev** (`dhi.io/datahub-upgrade:<tag>-dev`) — includes a shell and package manager for development and debugging
  workflows. Runs as root.
- **FIPS** (`dhi.io/datahub-upgrade:<tag>-fips`) — wires BouncyCastle FIPS into the JVM as the JCE provider via
  `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS=@/datahub/datahub-upgrade/scripts/datahub-fips.properties`, so all Java TLS and JCE operations use
  FIPS 140-validated cryptography. The environment variable `DATAHUB_FIPS=true` is set in this variant.
- **FIPS dev** (`dhi.io/datahub-upgrade:<tag>-fips-dev`) — combines the FIPS cryptographic configuration with the dev
  tooling.
