## About Cilium Hubble Proto

The Hubble Proto hardened image provides Protocol Buffer compiler plugins for generating Go code from proto definitions.
Hubble is the observability platform for Cilium, a cloud-native networking and security solution for Kubernetes.

This image contains three protoc plugins: `protoc-gen-go` for generating Go message types, `protoc-gen-go-grpc` for
generating gRPC service definitions, and `protoc-gen-go-json` for JSON marshaling support. The plugin versions match
those used in upstream Cilium's build tooling. The image contains only the protoc plugins themselves, not the `protoc`
compiler. These plugins can be copied into build environments where `protoc` is available, or used in multi-stage Docker
builds for reproducible code generation.

[official Cilium documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble/).
